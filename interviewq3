1) Live coding challenge where I filled in some function that retrieved an organized data from a search API. 
2) System design interview that involoved finding the issues with a system that updates information form a database via a webhook to a bunch of external services 
3) Went over the technical challenge I did prior to the interview and asked me to think about improvements I could have made to it and how I'd handle next steps.
